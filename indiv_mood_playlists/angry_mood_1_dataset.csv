all chemicals, vitamins and minerals\nVicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm\nTo see the vein like a chicken on the barn\nTop Cat chat, let\'s begin another yarn\nThat\'s flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm\'?\nBut roosters don\'t fly like boosters don\'t buy\nSo what powers cowards to get them to the top\nJust to fall asleep listening to Bach?\nThe ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop\nDribbling the eye across the prism of a clock\nThat lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading\nThey catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings\nNow what\'s a coffin with a scratched ceiling?\nAnd what\'s the talking without the match feeling\nThat\'s buried living, And cherry picking\nEvery lemon from your berry system\nThen proceed with the pack feeding\nWhen I was young I had visions of another world\nSneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL\nIncense smoke made vortices and other curls\nCasting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls\nI like my pancakes cut in swirls\nMoroccan moles and undercover squirrels\nI like cartoons, southern cities with large moons\nFaith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms\nApologize for my weird mix\nWhat taste like hot dogs and tear drips\nAnd looks like pantomime and clear bricks\nAnd smells like shotguns and deer piss\nThey on their hunt, kind of salty that I\'m going hard\nFirst part of a party, that I throw in parts\nOne minute you\'re playing pool, next minute you\'re throwing darts\nBut that\'s how you do with a party that you throw in bars\nI run the Gambit like I\'m throwing cards\nFrom Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard\nPaint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes\nNerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake\nA word game back up plan that can dam lakes\nBackup the wordplay ain\'t playing that the man\'s states\nMeans I can still be the man if the dam breaks\nAnd when demand brakes I\'m reflectious, what they can\'t face\nMy peers will still treat the mirror like it\'s a fan base\nThe unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine\nThat hovers above cities like weather men\nOr maybe weather woman\nWhatever better to tell ya weather comin\'\nI prefer girls to reign all over the world\nAnd not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance\nOr rain like a slight chance of rain when it\'s raining\nOr rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man\nBut Reign like Queens that reign over made man\nAnd not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen\nBut Queen like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it\'s a heat wave\nSo you make a fan by waving your hand, I\'m talking wave, like you saying, ""Hey man!""\nAnd not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless\nYou gotta treat your vocal chords like it\'s a fortress\nAnd treat every single one of your words like reinforcements\nAnd especially when you\'re recording\nCause that\'s the portion that\'s important\nWhen I was reporting that I was poor, but now I\'m more than (poor)\nIt\'s still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots\nCrying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops\nDeep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots\nA little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop\nAnd a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop\nAnd fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box\nSo the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...\nThen it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox\nThen heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot\nCause he want what we got, like yeah\nThen forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey\nThen spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery\nNot scorching nor sorbet-y\nFrom the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery\nComing down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall\nA more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll\nA river of women like a Brazilian Carnival\nSwimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol\nSomebody give them the volleyballs\nIf you love her, don\'t ever send her to Mally Mall\'s\nHomie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly\'s claws\nComing out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras\nThe fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call\nMy rap position was black condition and activism\nAmmunition for abolition, missions attacking systems\nBut they not apt to listen, unless it\'s dropping on Activision\nAre we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?\nOperating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison\nChicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion\nOr are we more...\n...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings\nPreoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other\'s royal saintings?\nI sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings\nUhhh!
