We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.\nStan:\tBubye, Fartboy.\nKyle:\tSee ya.\nPip:\tGood day, Damien. How are you?\nDamien:\tThose guys farted on me, and then called me-\nPip:\tFartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.\n[Skeeter's bar; people are having drinks. Chef is at the bar talking to someone. Jesus throws open the doors and enters]\nJesus:\tAhm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-\nChef:\tOh ooh. [a woman at a nearby table whistles the same thing]\nJesus:\tI have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning. [Two men at the bar look at each other] In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!\nPriest:\tYou should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!\nJesus:\tYour bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!\nPriest:\tOho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.\nJesus:\tI implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.\nPriest:\tJesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!\nMr. Garrison:\tOh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.\nJimbo:\tYeah.\nPriest:\tPraise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later. [Jesus turns and walks out] What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?\nMr. Garrison:\tYeah, crazy. [Two men that look like Bill and Fosse chortle behind him]\nMan 3:\tHe's so gay.\nMan 4:\tYeah. [The two men seen earlier toast the comments, and Jesus looks in once more.]\nJesus:\tYou're all a bunch of Judases!\n[Outside the bar. Jesus runs into Stan, Kyle, and Kenny]\nStan:\tHey, Jesus.\nJesus:\tWhat are you doing out so late, kids?\nKyle:\tWe have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.\nJesus:\tOh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?\nStan:\tSh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.\nKyle:\tYeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?\nJesus:\tNo, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?\n[Satan's press conference. At least three television stations (4, 11, and 38) have crews present]\nReporter 1:\tSatan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?\nSatan:\tI will crush him like a little bug!\nReporter 2:\tSatan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War? [Satan thinks a moment, then begins to answer, but a hand covers his mouth]\nDon King:\tLet's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.\n[A training room. Jesus is working on a punching bag while Stan and Kyle look on. Cartman enters]\nCartman:\tYou guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?\nStan:\tHere Jesus, drink these raw eggs.\nJesus:\tNo way, dude!\nChef:\t[in the ring] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.\nStan:\tBut you're his sparring partner, Chef.\nKyle:\tYeah, you have to hit him.\nJesus:\tSatan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.\nChef:\tOkay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?\nJesus:\tGive it your best sho- [poof] Oh! [falls back to the floor]\nChef:\tOh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!\nJesus:\tAnybody get the number of that truck? [drops his head]\n[Cartman's birthday party; several balloons are tethered to the banner. Carnival music plays. Two elephants are present, as is the Ferris wheel, all in the backyard]\nLiane:\tCome on, kiddies. Eat more.\nCartman:\t[greeting children as they come in with their presents] Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.\nChef:\tYup! Here's your present, children. [hands Cartman his gift] Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.\nKyle:\tHey, you just got here, Chef!\nChef:\tI know, but the fight is starting.\nStan:\tDude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.\nMrs Cartman:\t[turning to see what Stan said, and sees Chef] Mmmmm.\nChef:\tMmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.\n[On the sidewalk in front of Cartman's house, Damien and Pip sit]\nDamien:\tI guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.\nPip:\tYes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.\nDamien:\tThe other kids have always hated you?\nPip:\tOh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. [Damien gets an idea]\n[South Park Forum]\nMichael Buffer:\tIn the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ! [the crowd cheers] And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub! [the crowd now cheers for Satan. Jesus turns and glowers at them, and they shrink away] Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!\nReferee:\tOkay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles. [the bell rings]\n[Cartman's birthday party. A carnie does tricks. Damien enters with Pip in tow]\nCartman:\tHey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?\nStan:\tYeah, you weren't invited, new kid.\nKyle:\tAnd neither were you, Pip!\nPip:\tYes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-\nDamien:\tWait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party. [His eye flare up again. Rectus... dominus... Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.]\nPip:\t[Small demons grab him. ... sancti... cheesy poofs... ] Aaaa! [He is launched like a rocket] Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! [He gives off fireworks]\nKyle:\tWow!\nStan:\tWhoa, that was cool! [The children, Bebe, Wendy, and Clyde among them, look up and are duly impressed. They applaud]\nKyle:\tHey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.\nCartman:\tYeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]\n[South Park Forum, round 2. Satan and Jesus meet up. Satan gives Jesus a hard left, throwing him against the ropes. The crowd cheers. Jesus looks back, and they are silent. Jesus turns to fight, but receives a blow in the abdomen, again stumbling to the ropes. Satan gives him a left cross. Satan stands back, and Jesus' halo now flutters all over the place]\nSatan:\tCome on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!\n[Cartman's birthday party. He is now opening his presents]\nCartman:\tOooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[she leaves] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? [thumps the table in anger]\nKyle:\tIt's a game, dude. It's really fun.\nCartman:\tYOU SON OF A BITCH! [lunges towards Kyle]\nKyle:\t[as he is pinned by Cartman] Aaaaa!\nCartman:\tYOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! [slapping him around by now]\nKyle:\tThey were all out of 'em dude!\nCartman:\tI HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!\nKyle:\t[At the same time] Aaaaaaaa!\nCartman:\t[getting up and moving towards the center of the yard] That's it! Party is over! [the kids look glum] Everybody go home! [he turns the party switch off. Music slows to a stop, everything goes dark, and the banner floats away] GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! [Stan and Kyle stop]\nStan:\tWhoa, dude, you need to mellow out!\nCartman:\tTake your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! [Throws it at Kyle, who is felled by it. The kids regroup in front of the house]\nDamien:\tWow. That kid has some emotional problems.\nStan:\tAaanh, he does this all the time.\nChef:\tCome on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!\nPip:\t[descending] Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.\n[South Park Forum, a later round. Satan gives Jesus a fierce left, launching him into the air and against the ropes again. Jesus comes forward, and Satan gives him a right to the face.]\nJesus:\tOh! [backs up helplessly]\nSatan:\tFight, dammit! [gives him another right to the face]\nJesus:\tOow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh! [throws him against the rope, then gives him another right to the face. Jesus now has a swollen left eye]\nStan:\t[as he, Kyle, and Kenny approach Jesus' corner] Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [the round ends] You've got to fight, Jesus.\nJesus:\tWhy? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.\nKyle:\tSomebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.\nJesus:\tIt doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.\nStan:\tGoddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!\nKyle:\tUuuuh. Stan?\nStan:\tNancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!\nKyle:\tStan.\nStan:\tShe wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!\nKyle:\tStan!\nStan:\t[turning to Kyle] What?\nKyle:\tNancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.\nStan:\t[thinks a moment] ... Really?\nKyle:\tYeah, dude!\nStan:\tHoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks. [Jesus takes a ladleful of water from a pail next to him] You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'\nJesus:\t... Who said that?\nStan:\tYou did, Jesus. [Jesus ponders these words as he looks at Satan]\nJesus:\tYou're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! [gets up as the next round begins and fights without his halo]\nKyle:\tWow. Did he say that in the Bible?\nStan:\tNah, I saw it on Star Trek.\nKyle:\tHmmm.\nSatan:\t[Satan takes a couple of swing at Jesus, but Jesus ducks them] Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!\nJesus:\tOkay, pal. You asked for it! [The crowd looks on as Jesus prepares to punch Satan. Jesus delivers the blow, but nothing happens. The sound of escaping air is heard. Stan just buries his head in his hands in disbelief]\nSatan:\t[protecting his ribs] Ooooooh, you got me. [drops flat on his back]\nReferee:\tOne... Two... Three...\nJimbo:\tNo way! He barely touched him!\nReferee:\t... Seven... Eight [Satan opens his left eye, then closes it again.]... Nine... Ten. You're out! [The match ends, and Jesus jumps up in victory]\nStan, Kyle:\tOur Savior!\nMichael Buffer:\tThe winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ! [Satan pops right back up]\nMr. Garrison:\tHey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!\nJimbo:\tYeah!\nSatan:\tFools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win? [The crowd wonders] Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA! [dances out of the ring]\nPriest:\tI don't believe this!\nMr. Garrison:\tYeah, what a mean thing to do!\nSatan:\t[now on the Forum floor] Farewell, fools!\nJimbo:\tMan, that guy is a jerk. [Satan dances away and Stan enters the ring]\nStan:\t[over the microphone] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.\nMr. Garrison:\tBoy, did we get screwed.\nChef:\tJesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?\nJesus:\tAw heck. [puts his halo back on] Do I have a choice? [The crowd cheers with relief]\nJimbo:\tWell, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus! [Kenny is highlighted] Ih-it's comin' right for us! [pulls out a semi-automatic and fires away at Kenny. Kenny is soon on the floor with his head blown off.]\nStan:\tOh my God, they killed Kenny.\nKyle:\tYou bastard!\nDamien:\tWell, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you. [rats swarm all over Kenny's head]\nStan:\tYou're leaving already?\nDamien:\tI have to. My dad's always on the move. [the rats leave also]\nStan:\tWow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.\nKyle:\tYeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.\nStan:\tParents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?\n[Cartman's backyard. He's the only one at the picnic table, and it's still full of food. Cartman looks full, though]\nLiane:\tMore pie, hon?\nCartman:\tEh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.""}"
