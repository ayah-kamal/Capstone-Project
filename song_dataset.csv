[Verse 1]
When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stucco

[Pre-Chorus]
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight

[Chorus]
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met

[Verse 2]
And here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not

[Chorus]
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
It's for the best

[Outro]
I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

[Verse 1]
In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I’m here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

[Verse 2]
Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I’m a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

[Chorus]
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

[Verse 2]
I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

[Verse 1]
There's no life, without love they say
None worth having anyway
You're a mystery to me some days
That's what keeps me sane
A heart that yearns is always young
But you can't love just anyone
It's been a while since 21, I still feel the same

[Chorus]
Take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to the silence I need
Take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
Wherever you are's where I call home

[Verse 2]
'Cause we're just you and me
We drink and laugh and dance 'till 3
I have everything I need when I'm with you alone
Home is where we stay all night
No roof above our starry sky
I'd lie here till the day I die and our time together's flown

[Chorus]
So take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a silence I need
Take me home and don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
Wherever you are's where I call home

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
And I know I've made mistakes at times
Every now and then I've made you cry
For that I'm sorry
They were few and far between
We're closer now than we've ever been
You know I'm sorry

[Outro]
I used to wonder why I'm here
No rhyme no reason would appear
Since we've met, it's loud and clear
I'm here to see you home

[Verse 1]
I found you in the summer heat, of 1953
Wise words from your father said
""I know that boy's your brother's friend
But I don't think he keeps comin' round for him""
Again and again and again

[Verse 2]
I had to swim away
Semper Fi, but I'll be back someday
I'll take you by the hand and say
""Be mine, be mine, be mine""

[Chorus]
And if someday, you grow tired and your memory fades
It's alright, I will never leave your side
And oh when it's time, you can come find me
In 1953

[Verse 3]
Leave New York and see the countryside
Little city and a bigger life
Watch it grow into a thousand eyes
It's ours, it's ours, it's ours
Oh it's ours, it's ours, it's ours

[Chorus]
And if someday, you grow tired and your memory fades
It's alright, I will never leave your side
And oh when it's time, you can come find me
In 1953

""And he was my brother's friend, years later my father said
You know, I think he's comin' to see you""

[Bridge]
It's written in the gold ring

[Dialogue]
""That could be true""
""It is true""

[Bridge cont]
Passed down the light
Hangin' in the branches

[Dialogue]
""We landed on the right path I really feel""

[Bridge cont]
You see it in their eyes
Pressed in the concrete

[Dialogue]
""But it was a good life, I'm very happy""

[Bridge cont]
Where we used to reside
It's larger than life

[Chorus]
And if someday, you grow tired and your memory fades
It's alright, I will never leave your side
And oh when it's time, you can come find me

Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies are blinking at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

[Chorus]
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You who shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

[Verse 1]
Fading hearts and changing weather
Some for worse and some for better
Stay alive by boxing clever
Just don't let the fear take hold

[Pre-Chorus]
We all need a hideaway
A moment in the dark
Too long in the light of day
Forgetting who we are

[Chorus]
Do you feel all alone
Like your heart's in vertigo?
Lights are on, nobody's home
You've got nowhere left to go
But you better believe me, I've seen it
So many of us up on the ceiling
Think we're hangin' upside down
But maybe we're the right way round

[Verse 2]
Trapped against the raging tide
Piece by piece we come to life
All we ever thought was wrong
Was leading us here, leading us here all along

[Pre-Chorus]
We all need a hideaway
A moment in the dark
Too long in the light of day
Forgetting who we are

[Chorus]
Do you feel all alone
Like your heart's in vertigo?
Lights are on, nobody's home
You've got nowhere left to go
But you better believe me, I've seen it
So many of us up on the ceiling
Think we're hangin' upside down
Maybe we're the right way round

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Maybe we're the right way round
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Maybe we're the right way round

We're not losing all control
We're just learning how to float
And though our hearts aren't made of gold

We're just learning how to float
And though our hearts aren't made of gold
We glow, we glow

Do you feel all alone
Like your heart's in vertigo?
Lights are on, nobody's home
You got nowhere left to go
But you better believe me, I've seen it
So many of us up on the ceiling
Think we're hangin' upside down

[Chorus]
Do you feel all alone
Like your heart's in vertigo?
Lights are on, nobody's home
You've got nowhere left to go
But you better believe me, I've seen it
So many of us up on the ceiling
Think we're hangin' upside down
But maybe we're the right way round

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Maybe we're the right way round
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Maybe we're the right way round

[Verse 1]
I drove all night to Phoenix, just to blow 15 months rent
She said I was the best, she said I was the best
I got annihilated and DM'ed one of your friends
I hoped it wouldn't send, I hoped it wouldn't send
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Another anniversary, no diamonds and no date
Birthdays work the same, I'll always be this way
Just because I fuck up doesn't mean I've got no heart
Doesn't mean I've got no heart

[Chorus]
Sorry, but some days aren't so pretty
I wanna hit the brakes, but I hit the gas
I go 5150
Sometimes you wanna change, when you know you can't
5150, 5150

[Verse 3]
Good news never seems to catch on fire like the bad
We tore through Paris, France
But we don't ever talk of that
And just because I fuck up doesn't mean I've got no heart
Doesn't mean I've got no heart

[Chorus]
Sorry, but some days aren't so pretty
I wanna hit the brakes, but I hit the gas
I go 5150
Sometimes you wanna change, when you know you can't
5150, 5150
5150, 5150

[Outro]
(5150) I got annihilated and DM'ed one of your friends
(5150) I saw the blue dot flash and still I left it on unread
(5150) And just because I fuck up doesn't mean I've got no heart
(5150) I drove all night to Phoenix, just to know that we can never be apart
