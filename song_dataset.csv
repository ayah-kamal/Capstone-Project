When I return to dust?
A sea to wash away the last of us
It's such a funny feeling
The world's at war again
But in this very moment
Oh, it couldn't matter less  (Oh, oh)
Immersed in deepest ocean
The waves all move as one
Then separate themselves under the sun

And as we sing this familiar song
I thought I'm gonna miss your love when it's gone
Will it flow into the river?
Or will it go to waste?
Before we drift away
Before we drift away

Somnus waits for no one
A clock without a facе
Will it feel like an arrest or our escapе?

And as we sing this familiar song
I thought I'm gonna miss your love when it's gone
Will it flow into the river?
Or will it go to waste?
Before we drift away
Before we drift away
I'm gonna hang on this forever

[Verse 1]
It's the evening light
Shining through the curtains
Time before the night
When everything is golden
You’re sitting on the chair
Wrapped inside a bedsheet
Playing with your hair
Watching people on high street

[Chorus]
If I wished myself a superpower
I would make this moment last for hours
If I had my will
Time would just stand still
Wait for me until
I find some magic film
To take a photograph and live inside

[Verse 2]
Sun is going down
Your skin is like a painting
Light is perfect now
I can feel it changing
Kids are probably soon
Don't get me wrong I'm ready
I know what to do
When we’re no longer two
When us means more than me and you (Oh)

[Chorus]
If I wished myself a superpower
I would make this moment last for hours
If I had my will
Time would just stand still
Wait for me until
I find some magic film
To take a photograph and live inside

[Bridge]
I need some way to prove that this was real
A memory is not enough
I'm scared that I'll forget the way it feels to be young and in love

[Outro]
Let me stay right here
Just a moment longer
The picture is so clear
Please let this last forever

I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

(Uh)
(Mmmmm)

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric

I stayed in here for ages
And felt the sunlight fading
On you, you know
On you, you know

But it's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
It's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
And I won't look back in time
'Cause, darling, it's just the way we say goodbye

So take this plane, delay it
I heard the music fading
With you, you know
With you
We'll stay outside the cages
And read all the last pages
With you, you know
With you

And I miss you
God, I miss you
Love, I miss you
You know I do

But it's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
It's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
And I won't look back in time
'Cause, darling, it's just the way we say goodbye

Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh
Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh
Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh
Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh

And I miss you
God, I miss you
Love, I miss you
You know I do

And I won't look back in time
'Cause, darling, it's just the way we say goodbye
Just the way we say goodbye
Just the way we say goodbye"

[Verse 1]
Lying in this empty bed
I wonder where you lay your head, I
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love
I know you said we needed space
But now you're pretty far away, and
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love

[Chorus]
So don’t say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did
And don't say he could ever treat you better, better than I did
He doesn't know your aching heart
Know your battle scars like I do
Don’t say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did

[Verse 2]
You say I should've seen the signs
But how am I meant to read your mind?
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love

[Chorus]
So don't say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did
And don't say he could ever treat you better, better than I did
He doesn't know your aching heart
Know your battle scars like I do
Don't say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Love you like I, love you like I did
Oh oh oh

[Bridge]
But if I'm honest with myself
It ain't so easy now to admit
And maybe all of me, oh every part of me
Just wasn’t what you needed

[Alternate Chorus]
So I know he will always love you like I, love you like I did
And I know maybe he could treat you better, better than I did
Oh he knows your aching heart
Knows your battle scars like I do
But I know he will always love you like I, love you like I did

[Outro]
Ooh, love you like I, love you like I did

As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be

Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

Because I dropped your hand while dancing

Champagne problems

My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my

Heavy like a loaded gun

I'm coming up only to show you wrong
And to know you is hard, we wonder
To know you all wrong, we were

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
There's cups in the lake, and heat from the beam
Rising seas, and a world on fire
Sun shines, so we draw the blinds
Someone chuckles from the back of a fire, and now
Too late to go outside
There's money in a pocket, but it sure ain't mine
Some days I'm doing fine
Most I'm losing my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't take it
This ever-changing, spinning world
But maybe I can make it
If we plant seeds in the dirt

[Chorus]
I think I need a change of scene
I think I need to change my life
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never
Says a word it doesn't mean
Makes me feel like I'm alive
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never dies
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 2]
There's a flood in the south, and a kid so high
He can't remember how to ride his bike
Moon shines on a silver dime
But I picked it up, so I guess it's mine
Painted grass, and smog in the sky
But can I just kiss that teardrop in your eye?
Some days you're doing fine
Most you're losing your mind

[Chorus]
I think I need a change of scene
I think I need to change my life
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never
Says a word it doesn't mean
Makes me feel like I'm alive
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never dies

Better than I do right now
I want to feel so help me feel

And I've been waiting for someone to come and save me
So won't you save me?

I can bring you back and help you feel
Better than you have before
Ooh trust me I know how this goes
I know what it's like to feel all alone

Pour out your sweat with me

'Cause no one cares
Please stop thinking
Please just be here

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had"

Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Verse 1]
When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

[Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

[Post-Chorus]
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Verse 2]
When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

[Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

[Bridge]
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Hip hip

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go"

'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am107EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Refrain]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Verse]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Bridge]
Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

[Refrain]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love
