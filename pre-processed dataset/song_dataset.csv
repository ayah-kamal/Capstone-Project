(Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose)

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (Oh-oh, yeah)

Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Verse 2]
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

There is so much space between us

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart

Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see

Burn everything you love then burn the ashes

Spat back out the monster that you see

To quiet dances on a screen
So long to burning slowly
Smelling sweat and kerosene
And all the actors on the stage are rolling cigarettes
And whispering so low
Call my parents up, tell them I’m not coming home
So long to silent movies
To waking early, staying late
I think I’ll head on down to Reno
Try my hand at real-estate
And I’ll fix up a Cadillac and find a girl who  Likes to dance so slow
Call my parents up, tell them I’m already home
But I swear I’ve seen my share of black and white
And I swear this screen, it nevеr tells the story right
So long to silent moviеs
To all the talking in between
Cleaning dust off of the press-box
And fixing broken tape machines
Wasn’t much of an actor, was I?
I ain’t much of anything at all
But I can’t see those marquee lights
That are hanging on the wall
But I swear I’ve seen my share of black and white
And I swear this screen, it never tells the story right

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Immersed in deepest ocean

Shining through the curtains
Time before the night
When everything is golden
You’re sitting on the chair
Wrapped inside a bedsheet
Playing with your hair
Watching people on high street

If I wished myself a superpower
I would make this moment last for hours
If I had my will
Time would just stand still
Wait for me until
I find some magic film
To take a photograph and live inside

Sun is going down
Your skin is like a painting
Light is perfect now
I can feel it changing
Kids are probably soon
Don't get me wrong I'm ready
I know what to do
When we’re no longer two
When us means more than me and you (Oh)

Just a moment longer
The picture is so clear

Sensual politics

Drunk under a streetlight, I

Giving me your weekends, I

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(Uh)

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)

With future pixels in factories far away

The way you serenade the room
Her sister's got no ID
She won't let me be Springsteen
Boy, your friends are stars
So we'll go sing karaoke

[Chorus]
Tuck you under
My wing and try to take you home
Start to wonder
If we can make it on our own

[Verse 2]
Stand up on the bar
Is that the sound of a rooster?
Turned sour in the car
You're sick and I just hold your hair
Riding coattails for free
Never was part of the dream
Stand up on the bar
Show me the sound of a rooster

[Chorus]
Tuck you under
My wing and try to take you home
Start to wonder
If we can make it on our own

So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

[Bridge]
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
I know that you're scared because I'm so open

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

There's cups in the lake, and heat from the beam
Rising seas, and a world on fire
Sun shines, so we draw the blinds
Someone chuckles from the back of a fire, and now
Too late to go outside
There's money in a pocket, but it sure ain't mine
Some days I'm doing fine
Most I'm losing my mind

And I can't take it
This ever-changing, spinning world
But maybe I can make it
If we plant seeds in the dirt

I think I need a change of scene
I think I need to change my life
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never
Says a word it doesn't mean
Makes me feel like I'm alive
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never dies
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
There's a flood in the south, and a kid so high
He can't remember how to ride his bike
Moon shines on a silver dime
But I picked it up, so I guess it's mine
Painted grass, and smog in the sky
But can I just kiss that teardrop in your eye?
Some days you're doing fine
Most you're losing your mind

I think I need a change of scene
I think I need to change my life
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never
Says a word it doesn't mean
Makes me feel like I'm alive
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never dies

Better than I do right now
I want to feel so help me feel
Better than yesterday

And people embrace from time that they've spent apart
And I've been waiting for someone to come and save me
So won't you save me?

It's just like watching a party from the other room
It's just like sad people dancing around the room
It's just like sad people dancing
It's just like sad people dancing

I can bring you back and help you feel
Better than you have before
Ooh trust me I know how this goes
I know what it's like to feel all alone
I don't want to go back to that
I know you don't either
Eat your heart out baby
Pour out your sweat with me
No one is watching
'Cause no one cares
Please stop thinking
Please just be here
