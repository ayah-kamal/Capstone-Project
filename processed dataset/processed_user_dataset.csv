[Intro]
(Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

[Verse 2]
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

[Verse 3]
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

[Bridge]
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos

Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie

Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Verse 2]
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Bridge]
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated

And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart

I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines

The ringing in my ears gets violent

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember, ""Baby, come home""

And just stay with me

The sweetness never lasts, you know

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

[Verse 2]
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

[Verse 3]
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

[Bridge]
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Verse 1]
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

[Chorus]
(Uh)
(Mmmmm)

[Verse 2]
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

[Chorus]
(Here we go again)
That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

[Verse 3]
Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

[Chorus]
(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)

But now you're pretty far away, and
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love

And don't say he could ever treat you better, better than I did
He doesn't know your aching heart
Know your battle scars like I do
Don’t say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did

[Verse 2]
You say I should've seen the signs
But how am I meant to read your mind?
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love

And don't say he could ever treat you better, better than I did

But if I'm honest with myself
It ain't so easy now to admit
And maybe all of me, oh every part of me

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

[Bridge]
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
I know that you're scared because I'm so open

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

There's cups in the lake, and heat from the beam
Rising seas, and a world on fire
Sun shines, so we draw the blinds
Someone chuckles from the back of a fire, and now
Too late to go outside
There's money in a pocket, but it sure ain't mine
Some days I'm doing fine
Most I'm losing my mind

And I can't take it
This ever-changing, spinning world
But maybe I can make it
If we plant seeds in the dirt

I think I need a change of scene
I think I need to change my life
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never
Says a word it doesn't mean
Makes me feel like I'm alive
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never dies
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
There's a flood in the south, and a kid so high
He can't remember how to ride his bike
Moon shines on a silver dime
But I picked it up, so I guess it's mine
Painted grass, and smog in the sky
But can I just kiss that teardrop in your eye?
Some days you're doing fine
Most you're losing your mind

I think I need a change of scene
I think I need to change my life
Thank god our love is evergreen
The only thing that never, the only thing that never
Says a word it doesn't mean
Makes me feel like I'm alive
Thank god our love is evergreen
