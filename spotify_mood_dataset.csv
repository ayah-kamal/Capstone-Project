As I'm looking backwards in order to look forward what I'm realizing is it what there all along. You know, I am in so many ways still the artist that I was when I was eighteen, but the difference is I think I'm only just now starting to really believe it and it means that I can't wait to see what I make next because I think for a while I needed to prove it. I needed to prove to myself that I could do this and that I could make it my life. But now there's nothing to prove. The only thing that's left is the music and that is almost the greatest challenge of all because the only person I have to please is myself\n\nLike, this next batch of music, as I'm thinking about making it, like, or as I'm working through the process and hearing parts of these records and these things I've done and how my past is weaving it's way back into my present. I mean, that's the most emotional thing about listening through to all of this music it's just I'm in this place now where every dream I have possibly ever had or said under my breath or even thought was too big to try and dream about I've been able to do. And the real question I'm asking is: Where do I go from here?\n\nYou know, with the support of many, many, many people I have been afforded the opportunity to do this with my life and I take that responsibility very seriously. It feels like the greatest gift that anyone has ever given me and it feels like I have really been tasked with the role of feeling everything I possibly can and reporting back. Like, it's– it, like, makes me teary to think about trying to tell that eighteen-year-old girl, like, what my life looks like now, but it makes me so happy. It's absolutely everything I've ever wanted. There is nothing else in my life I have every loved more that doing this thing and the fact that I get to do it everyday still completely blows my mind, and it, like, it brings me more joy and sense of purpose than anything and is the only thing in this time that is so uncertain that makes me feel completely at peace and alive and I– I just I hope I get to do it for the rest of my life""}"
